Use case:

1. redis as cache
2. we would ping redis for information
3. if redis does not have the desired information, we ping mysql
4. if mysql returns result we push result to redis and set expiration date

Necessary components: 

1. redis on Amazon ElasticCache
2. routes through easiersolar for tunnel to elasticcache, because there is no public access to elasticcache
3. mysql hosted on amazon aurora
